Basically you need to install subversion first:

sudo apt-get install subversion
Then you need to checkout the SVN repository, add your files and commit; that looks similar to this:

svn co http://some.url/to/the/repository
cd repository-folder
cp ../files/from/otherfolder .
svn add the/new/files
svn commit
