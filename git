create a folder in github

First you have to clone the repository to you local machine

git clone github_url local_directory
Then you can create local folders and files inside your local_directory, and add them to the repo using

git add file_path
You can also add everything using.

git add .
Note that git does not track empty folder. A work-around is to create a file inside the empty folder you want to track. I usually name that file empty but it can be whatever name you choose.

Finally, you commit and push back to github

git commit
git push
