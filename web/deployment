first export project as a war file
then install tomcat{X}

After that, There are three important directories for Tomcat:
/etc/tomcat{X} for configuration
/etc/tomcat{X} for runtime, called CATALINA_HOME
/usr/share/tomcat{X}-root for webapps

if tomcat7 could not find {JAVA_HOME}
sudo gedit /etc/default/tomcat7
modify java_home part with "/usr"

sudo service tomcat7 restart

cp *.war to /var/lib/tomcat7/webapps

for jdbc issue, please refer to the following post in which tomcat lib directory is "/usr/share/tomcat7/lib":
